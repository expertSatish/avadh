                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Bachelor of Pharmacy or B.Pharm is a 4 years undergraduate degree that teaches students about
                        drug synthesis, dosage formulation, analyzing the chemical nature and preclinical testing of new
                        drugs. Apart from the technical aspects of pharmacy, B Pharm also talks about marketing of
                        pharmaceutical products and patenting of new drugs. Right now, we are serving 60 seats of
                        B.Pharm in our college but we tend to increase the seats to 100 seats so that much more students
                        can get benefits and live up to the name of being pharmacist.</p>
